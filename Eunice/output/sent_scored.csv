Important Information

FINRAâ€™s Code of Conduct imposes restrictions on employeesâ€™ investments and requires financial disclosures that are uniquely related to our role as a securities regulator. FINRA employees are required to disclose to FINRA all brokerage accounts that they maintain, and those in which they control trading or have a financial interest (including any trust account of which they are a trustee or beneficiary and all accounts of a spouse, domestic partner or minor child who lives with the employee) and to authorize their broker-dealers to provide FINRA with duplicate statements for all of those accounts. All of those accounts are subject to the Codeâ€™s investment and securities account restrictions, and new employees must comply with those investment restrictionsâ€”including disposing of any security issued by a company on FINRAâ€™s Prohibited Company List or obtaining a written waiver from their Executive Vice Presidentâ€”by the date they begin employment with FINRA. Employees may only maintain securities accounts that must be disclosed to FINRA at one or more securities firms that provide an electronic feed (e-feed) of data to FINRA, and must move securities accounts from other securities firms to a firm that provides an e-feed within three months of beginning employment.

As standard practice, employees must also execute FINRAâ€™s Employee Confidentiality and Invention Assignment Agreement without qualification or modification and comply with the companyâ€™s policy on nepotism.

About FINRA

FINRA is an independent, non-governmental regulator for all securities firms doing business with the public in the United States. FINRA works to protect investors and maintain market integrity in a public-private partnership with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), while also benefiting from the SECâ€™s oversight. In its role as investor guardian, FINRA is informed, but not influenced, by the industry that it regulates. FINRAâ€™s independent regulation plays a critical role in Americaâ€™s financial systemâ€“all at no cost to taxpayers.

FINRA touches virtually every aspect of the securities businessâ€”from registering and educating industry participants to examining securities firms; writing rules; enforcing those rules and the federal securities laws; informing and educating the investing public; providing trade reporting and other industry utilities; and administering the largest dispute resolution forum for investors and registered firms. FINRA uses technology powerful enough to look across markets and detect potential abuses. Using a variety of data gathering techniques, we work to detect insider trading and any strategies firms or individuals use to gain an unfair advantage.
In today's fast-paced and complex global economy, FINRA is a trusted advocate for investors, dedicated to keeping the markets fair and proactively addressing emerging regulatory issues before they harm investors or the markets. FINRA operates from Washington, DC, and New York, NY, with other offices around the country.
