Important Information

FINRA’s Code of Conduct imposes restrictions on employees’ investments and requires financial disclosures that are uniquely related to our role as a securities regulator. FINRA employees are required to disclose to FINRA all brokerage accounts that they maintain, and those in which they control trading or have a financial interest (including any trust account of which they are a trustee or beneficiary and all accounts of a spouse, domestic partner or minor child who lives with the employee) and to authorize their broker-dealers to provide FINRA with duplicate statements for all of those accounts. All of those accounts are subject to the Code’s investment and securities account restrictions, and new employees must comply with those investment restrictions—including disposing of any security issued by a company on FINRA’s Prohibited Company List or obtaining a written waiver from their Executive Vice President—by the date they begin employment with FINRA. Employees may only maintain securities accounts that must be disclosed to FINRA at one or more securities firms that provide an electronic feed (e-feed) of data to FINRA, and must move securities accounts from other securities firms to a firm that provides an e-feed within three months of beginning employment.

As standard practice, employees must also execute FINRA’s Employee Confidentiality and Invention Assignment Agreement without qualification or modification and comply with the company’s policy on nepotism.

About FINRA

FINRA uses technology powerful enough to look across markets and detect potential abuses. Using a variety of data gathering techniques, we work to detect insider trading and any strategies firms or individuals use to gain an unfair advantage.
In today's fast-paced and complex global economy, FINRA is a trusted advocate for investors, dedicated to keeping the markets fair and proactively addressing emerging regulatory issues before they harm investors or the markets.

Data Scientist and Software Engineer, Python/R, Java

Portland, Oregon


We’re the Applied Intelligence Services team. We are engineers with depth in Machine Learning in statistics, and we’re looking for a Data Scientist and engineer to join us. We deliver novel “intelligence” solutions to delight New Relic’s customers. We do this by building out a platform of tools to meet the needs of product teams around the organization. Our mission is to proactively improve the customer’s ability to detect issues, reduce noise, resolve issues faster, and continuously improve their own practices. Work our team has shipped includes NRQL query facet suggestion, outlier alerting, error profiles, and time series baseline alerting.


Data Scientist means many things to many people, we mean a solid foundation in statistics and Machine Learning, and the ability to pragmatically apply both to real world problems that we ourselves ship to production.


What working on the team is like:
We sit together as a team, and have on the spot discussions as a team as-needed.
We support each other, both inside and across teams.
We often take on projects with goals that may turn out to be unachievable. This is different to pure engineering teams that are mostly about shipping solutions that you know can be built.
We are unusual with our Data Science problems in that we have to deliver solutions for datasets that we may only have eyeballed a small subset of the data for. I.e. we may iterate based on a sampling of customers data but it has to work well for entire customer base.
We deal with a lot of roadmap uncertainty. We organize our projects so that we can conclude an approach won’t work, scrap the project, and switch gears.
We almost always include elements of statistics in our work. So our solutions are often probabilistic in nature.
We focus on delivering production code at a regular cadence using agile techniques.
We deal with extremely high volumes of data so all of our services have to scale well and be operationally robust.
We are on-call for the services we ship (we own them!), so we’re very operationally minded.
We predominantly work on the backend, but will do front end work as needed.
We commonly use Docker, Kafka, Java, Kotlin, and expose GraphQL APIs.
To join this team, you must:
Be able to engineer code following best practices and work in modern engineering environments.
Be able to level up the team through your depth of understanding of statistics and Machine Learning (mostly the former), and your ability to apply statistics to real world problems (especially time series data).
Be able to communicate ideas effectively and collaborate on problem solving.
Example statistics problems you must be able to contribute meaningfully towards:
Non-exponential-smoothing approaches to central-tendency for univariate time series data. Solutions need to work in a streaming fashion on large volumes of data, and with both memory and time constraints.
Counter-factual analysis of systems given uncontrolled observational data. Solutions need to work in an ad-hoc on-demand fashion.
Outlier detection in time series data that can discover correlations (hopefully causal) in related time series. Solutions need to work in a streaming fashion on large volumes of data, and with both memory and time constraints.
You’ll love working with us the most if:
You are comfortable with a blend of pure engineering, experimentation, and research.
You care deeply about the customer’s experience, and seeing their problems solved is your main goal.
You get your best work done in a collaborative environment.
Please note, this position is not eligible for visa sponsorship.

At New Relic, we hire people who are eager to contribute to our culture, and we empower them to do just that. We take pride in thinking beyond our day-to-day job descriptions, and encourage you to actively seek out opportunities to create the type of work environment that you want to be a part of. What does this look like in action? You should be ready to be a “culture add” to New Relic and spend ~5% of your time finding meaningful ways to make this an even better place to work.
