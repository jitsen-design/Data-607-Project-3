Important Information

FINRA’s Code of Conduct imposes restrictions on employees’ investments and requires financial disclosures that are uniquely related to our role as a securities regulator. FINRA employees are required to disclose to FINRA all brokerage accounts that they maintain, and those in which they control trading or have a financial interest (including any trust account of which they are a trustee or beneficiary and all accounts of a spouse, domestic partner or minor child who lives with the employee) and to authorize their broker-dealers to provide FINRA with duplicate statements for all of those accounts. All of those accounts are subject to the Code’s investment and securities account restrictions, and new employees must comply with those investment restrictions—including disposing of any security issued by a company on FINRA’s Prohibited Company List or obtaining a written waiver from their Executive Vice President—by the date they begin employment with FINRA. Employees may only maintain securities accounts that must be disclosed to FINRA at one or more securities firms that provide an electronic feed (e-feed) of data to FINRA, and must move securities accounts from other securities firms to a firm that provides an e-feed within three months of beginning employment.

As standard practice, employees must also execute FINRA’s Employee Confidentiality and Invention Assignment Agreement without qualification or modification and comply with the company’s policy on nepotism.

About the World Bank Group:
Established in 1944, the WBG is one of the world’s largest sources of funding and knowledge for development solutions. In fiscal year 2018, the WBG committed $67 billion in loans, grants, equity investments and guarantees to its members and private businesses, of which $24 billion was concessional finance to its poorest members. It is governed by 188-member countries and delivers services out of 120 offices with nearly 15,000 staff located globally.
The WBG consists of five specialized institutions: the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The World Bank is organized into six client-facing Regional Vice-Presidencies, several corporate functions and thirteen Global Practices to bring best-in-class knowledge and solutions to regional and country clients.
DECDG houses the World Bank’s main Data Team, including the Secretariat of the Development Data Council (DDC), a data governance body that coordinates the World Bank Group’s approach to data, in support of the objectives to eradicate extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity. This position is in the Indicators & Services (DECIS) unit of DECDG. This team manages various high-quality data outputs, including the World Development Indicators (WDI) database, sub-national databases, and the World Bank’s data catalogue – the institutional hub where Bank’s data assets are stored and shared with both internal and external users.
The selected candidate will work with the Sustainable Development Statistics (SDS) team which is responsible for collecting and publishing reliable, high-quality statistics on demography, education, environment, finance and markets, health, labor, and poverty. The advertised position will focus on improving data, methods, documentation, and the dissemination of environment related indicators in the WDI. The WDI is an important public resource and attracts considerable interest with around 13 million unique visitors each year, its users including analysts, policymakers, students, academics, program managers, and all those curious about the state of the world - to find data related to all aspects of development, both historical and current, and to follow trends and monitor progress towards a host of goals and targets. The WDI is an important source of information on countries’ trajectories towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs’ strong focus on the environment and sustainability (e.g., Goals 6 on water, 7 on energy, 11 on sustainable cities, 12 on sustainable consumption, 13 on climate change, 14 on life under water, 15 on life above water) and the corresponding indicators place new demands on reporting on international environmental statistics. The selected candidate therefore would be expected to involve working on these areas, with a strong focus on geospatial data.
Note: If the selected candidate is a current Bank Group staff member with a Regular or Open-Ended appointment, s/he will retain his/her Regular or Open-Ended appointment. All others will be offered a 3-year term appointment

As a member of the first product engineering team at Motiion you have will have a unique opportunity to turning previously scattered and inconsistently structured data into directly actionable food industry insights to reduce waste, increase freshness and much more.
You have a proven track record of reading data and making solid conclusions. You know both the art and science of analytics - now only do you know how to find answers in the data, you also know which questions should be asked in the first place and what data might could help us further bolster our conclusions. You love engaging with customers, learn about their challenges and then dive into the data to see how to solve them!
We are building a product engineering team with a breadth of combined experiences so that we can collaboratively build great products. There are no hard requirements on specific educational background, technology, experience or geographical location. We are however looking for specific traits in the people we work with. You might not yet be able to check all of the boxes, but at least you aspire to do so!
Some signs of a great candidate
Toolbox oriented. Whether your background is in mathematics, statistics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, or something else, you have enough experience to intuitively shortlist tools and approaches from most of these disciplines.
Understanding business and customer needs. You believe in creating models that will help the company and make short- and long-termimpact, focusing on“bang-for-the-buck”.
Performance recognized by your peers. Past colleagues would love to work with you again.
Starter and finisher. You often identify a problem, design a solution and bring it to a state of completion - alone or with collaborators. You’ve worked with developers in the past, hope to continue doing so, but you would get far even without technical help.
Work hard and smart. Your work ethic is unquestioned, and you know how to get things done so you can balance your work and personal life in a sustainable way.
Disciplined and reliable. We are a remote company and you enjoy the benefits of working remotely while consistently delivering what you have committed to. When you hit a snag, you communicate and reset expectations early.
Collaborative. You know that your team members’ perspectives will make your solutions better. Similarly, you use your strengths to make the team perform.
Appreciation of honest feedback. You know that the best way to learn and grow is through constructive feedback delivered kindly, but without unnecessary ambiguity. You feedback given to as an opportunity to get better and strive to do the same for others.
Analytical and practical mind. You strive for simple, precise solutions to complex problems. Complex solutions are only acceptable when absolutely needed.
Why we are different
Our main goals with Motiion are easy to explain: We want to build a company that we would like to enjoy spending the rest of our careers in, that has a positive impact on the world and that will outlast us. Achieving these goals will be challenging, but we know we can do it. Here’s why:
A strong founder team
We, the founders, have a proven track record of building successful companies from scratch. We will take all of the amazing and painful experiences of the past and apply them to create a company we all will be very proud of.
Self-funded
The founders have invested $10 million to allow us to focus on building technology and product the right way. Our eyes are on the goals of building a global technology platform. We are laser focused on customer needs, but will make product priorities based on our long-term goals, not short-term revenue.
Remote-first
We believe technology that enables remote work to be better than a corporate office setting is already here and the world of business is just about to catch up. Remote work certainly comes with drawbacks, but the strongly believe the advantages vastly outnumber the disadvantages. Speaking to dozens of experienced remote employees has shown us that the number one obstacle to building a successful remote workplace is doing it half-way by having some people be co-located and some remote. We want the same mode of collaboration for everyone and our team will be working remotely most of the time.
This does not mean that you have to work from home all the time, or at all. Motiion will pay for co-working space if that’s what you prefer. We will also encourage team members that live in the same area to meet up and work together when it makes sense. We will also make sure we all meet regularly for real in-person interaction!
Personal impact of collaborating individuals
We have seen first-hand how corporate culture can devolve into empire building and reporting lines. Motiion will have great managers, but we recognize and value the skills of individual contributors. You can grow your career at Motiion doing the work you love and excel at. Your merit matters, not your title.
Benefits
We have top notch benefits, matching most of the large US tech companies, including 401k matching, excellent health insurance and a generous vacation policy."

Bold Metrics Inc. (BMI) has created a suite of AI technologies that allows brands to accurately predict customer body measurements and relate them to garment specifications. Using our cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, retailers and brands are ditching conventional sizing solutions and leveraging our technology to reduce returns and increase conversions. Ultimately, our goal is to revolutionize the apparel industry by leveraging this data to unlock body-relative apparel design.
Historically, apparel sizes have been generated in the absence of customer-driven body data. This has lead to a worldwide apparel waste problem caused by a high rate of returns coupled with a bad consumer experience around fit and sizing, often amplified online. Along with garment sizing optimizations, the downstream experience becomes more customer-driven, leading to a significant reduction in returns and happier customers.

Before the dawn of everything internet, insurance was intimate and personal. You walked down the street to chat with your broker and the risk to your business, your livelihood, was covered with a handshake. Today is different.
